In this task, I attempt to find best ways for the computer to solve maze puzzles.

For now, I will only be sticking to string literals. WIth time, I should be able to extend my knowledge to actual blocks.

As at this point, date - (Saturday, 07|10|2023, 09:07 am), I have:

i. Fixed parent issues.

ii. Implented the A* search algorithm.

iii. Implemented stack algorithm.

However, still needs some form of optimization. Also, I think it is using quite a lot of memory for a text-based system.

More work still to be done, but I am proud of my progress at this point.

./search1 is the old compiled file. "./search" is the new.
